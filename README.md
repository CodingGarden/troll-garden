* Change every 3rd link on page is a rick roll
* Mouse pointer jumps a small distance
* Mouse moves in wrong direction for small increments randomly
* Random notification sounds
  * Slack or Discord notification sound every so often
* Keydown event handler that repeats letters every so often
* Screen smudges, hair, bug, dead pixel
* Focus random inputs
* Actually show ads if they have adblocker
* Possibly: eject / open CD tray randomly
* Modify accept language of browser so pages load in another language
* When they google, show bing results
